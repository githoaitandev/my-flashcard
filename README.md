## Authentication

The application includes a comprehensive authentication system using Supabase Auth. Key features include:

- **User Registration and Login**: Supports email/password and Google OAuth.
- **Session Management**: Persistent user sessions with automatic token refresh.
- **Route Protection**: Middleware ensures only authenticated users can access certain pages.
- **User-Specific Data**: API routes and database queries are secured with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

### Setting Up Authentication

1. Configure Supabase Auth in the Supabase dashboard.
2. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase project URL and API key.
3. Ensure RLS policies are enabled and properly configured in the database.

## Middleware

- Middleware is used to protect routes and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
- Located in `middleware.ts`, it checks the user's authentication status before granting access to protected pages.

## Database Schema

The application uses Supabase PostgreSQL database. The main models are:

- **User**: Stores user information.
- **Deck**: Includes a `user_id` column to associate decks with specific users.
- **Flashcard**: Includes a `user_id` column for user-specific flashcards.
- **StudySession**: Tracks study sessions per user.

Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure that users can only access their own data.
